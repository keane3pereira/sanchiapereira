          <span class="body2">
            Narrowing down the solution, the idea I focused on was to design a
            food tour experience that is gamified on a no-code application.
            Elaborating on this idea using the improv method of “Yes, and?” ,
            the grew to a journey where the customer can win souvenirs, view
            information on their food guide including ratings and languages, and
            points that give them a free gift at the end of the tour. The client
            could partner with the local restaurants to dedicate one of their
            employees to attend to tourists, and retrain the employee,
            eliminating the need for tour guides, create a review and rating
            system on app to review the restaurant service.

            from innovation diffusion studies across multiple areas, E. Rogers

            of new ideas: High relative advantage, Compatibility, Low

            map. it first provides customers with instructions on how they can
            get started with their journey. The first restaurant icon is the
            first stop you visit. when you click in, it will show you fun facts
            about the restaurant's cultural background about the food.
            everything you need to know beforehand. on your way to the next
            restaurant we will be visiting, along the way, it will also show you
            any good views or photo spots. just to make the journey more
            entertaining, if the customers are interested, they can post.
